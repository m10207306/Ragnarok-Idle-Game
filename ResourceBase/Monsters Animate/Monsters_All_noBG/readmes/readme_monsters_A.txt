All monsters whose names start with A compiled by Angevon, except for the following:
Ancient Tree, Anubis, Antler Scaraba, Antler Scaraba Egg, and Aqua Elemental, which were compiled by Anni Korzeniowsky.
Alarm and Anolian were originally by Digital, and Alice and Angeling were originally by PCMorris; these have now been formatted by Angevon.
